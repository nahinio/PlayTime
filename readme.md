## 🎯 The Problem

You find an interesting YouTube playlist. Could be a tutorial series, a music collection, or a podcast archive. But there's no way to know: *"Can I actually finish this?"*

YouTube doesn't show total playlist duration upfront. You're left guessing, scrolling, or doing mental math.

**PlayTime fixes that.**
